In libinit.so
-------------
Function Having No Dependency - x()
Function Having Dependency    - y()
Calls x() internally.
Since x() is locally present so it can be resolved.

In libdep.so
------------
x() is present.
This is meant to be used as a global symbol.
This library symbols are set as global with RTLD_GLOBAL flags

Without flag RTLD_DEEPBIND in libinit.so loading
------------------------------------------------
Function Called -> y
--> Succeeds and gets called from libinit.so
Function Called -> x
--> Succeeds and gets called from libdep.so i.e global has
    more preference over the local x() already present in libinit.so

With flag RTLD_DEEPBIND in libinit.so loading
---------------------------------------------
Function Called -> x
--> Succeeds and gets called from libinit.so
Function Called -> y
--> Succeeds and gets called from the local libinit.so
    Global symbol is overridden with the use of this flag

We can see the contents of one.c and two.c to understand the flow
more accurately.
