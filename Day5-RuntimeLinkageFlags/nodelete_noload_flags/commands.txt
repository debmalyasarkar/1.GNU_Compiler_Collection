Function Having A Static Variable - x()

With flag RTLD_NODELETE in first call to load library
------------------------------------------------------
The library is not unloaded on calling the unload function.
The value of the static variable is retained.

With flag RTLD_NOLOAD in second call to load library
----------------------------------------------------
The library is not loaded again. The existing copy is used.
Accessing the static variable now gives the incremented value
over the previously retained value.

Cross Checking
---------------
To check we can comment this two flags and run the code.
We will observe that both times the static variable gives the 
initialized value.
