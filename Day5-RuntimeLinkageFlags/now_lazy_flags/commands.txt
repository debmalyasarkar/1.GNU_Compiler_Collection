In libinit.so
-------------
Function Having No Dependency - x()
Function Having Dependency    - y()

In libdep.so
------------
a() and b() functions are present.
y() calls b() so its dependent

With flag RTLD_NOW
-------------------
Function Called -> x
--> dlopen() fails
Function Called -> y
--> dlopen() fails

With flag RTLD_LAZY
--------------------
Function Called -> x
--> dlopen() succeeds
    Process succeeds
Function Called -> y
--> dlopen() succeeds
    Gives runtime failure when function is called

When dependent library is loaded then also function fails
because the symbols of the dependent library are not shared
with the calling library.
To make it work RTLD_GLOBAL must be used.
-> Security Concern to run untrusted code from malicious library
-> Calling Library may have same symbol
